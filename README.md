# Altea

Altea is an alternate universe (or ALTernate rEAlity) simulation experiment that is planned to run for 200 hours of work. The idea is to see where this project goes within that timeframe and if something truly intriguing and fun comes out of it. The original 200-hour version of Altea is public domain (licensed under The Unlicense), it may become something like MIT/GPL eventually if the project works out and becomes something more than just an experiment. For now, it's just a playground for me to see if this idea can advance to even a functional proof of concept stage or not.

# The Idea

The idea is to create a fully autonomous simulation that can, without any user input, create higher order interactions, creatures, places, landscapes and relationships between them. Essentially, the point is to see if it's possible to create a mini-universe from nothing that can function autonomously and follow its own rules. The only acceptable "user interaction" is setting some initial conditions for the simulation. Everything else should be "decided" randomly by the simulation itself. Basically, we start with particles/"atoms" and see if we can go towards something bigger.


Any kind of feedback/suggestions/ideas are greatly appreciated while I work out the outlines of this thing. The project is written in Rust/Bevy, so you can easily build and run the thing by just cloning the repo and `cargo build` / `cargo run`, as usual with Rust.
